# ðŸ§¬ Tracking the Evolution of the Hemoglobin Beta (HBB) Gene Across Species

## ðŸ“Œ Project Title:
**Tracking the Evolution of the Hemoglobin Beta (HBB) Gene Across Species**

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
This project aims to explore the evolutionary conservation of the **Hemoglobin Beta (HBB)** gene across six species. Using the skills acquired in Module 2 of the BioinformHER program, the project focuses on:

- Sequence retrieval  
- Multiple sequence alignment  
- Sequence logo generation  
- Phylogenetic tree construction  
- Interpretation of conserved regions and functional relevance
